# 19-Budget-Tracker

## Description
For this project I was given the front end and most of the back end of an fitness tracking application.  My role was to complete the back-end of this application by making if functional offline.  I did so by using *Express*, *Mongodb*, and *Mongoose*. Offline functionality was produced by introducing *indexedDB*
